# Machine Learning with Graphs

Components of a Network

+ Objects: nodes, vertices $N$
+ Interactions: links, edges $E$
+ System: network, graph $G(N,E)$



Graphs: A Common Language



Different Type of Graphs

![Directed vs. Undirected Graphs](Directed vs. Undirected Graphs.png)

Node Degrees

Bipartite Graph

folded/projected bipartite graphs

use adjacency matrix



**adjacency matrices are sparce**

Representing Graphs

+ Edge list
+ Adjacency list



Node and Edge Attributes

+ Weight 
+ Ranking
+ Type
+ Sign
+ Properties depending on the structure of the rest of the graph



Adjacency matrices

+ Weight
+ Self-edges
+ Multigraph



disconnect graph
